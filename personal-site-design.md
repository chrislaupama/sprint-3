What is your sites primary purpose?
- At this stage, probably a portfolio/blog website where I can share my development journey and projects.

Who is your target audience?
- Future employers, colleagues, friends and family.

 How do you want site visitors to interact with your site? What experience would you like them to have?
 - I would like them to use my site as a space to see what i've worked on, what my thoughts etc are and to get an overall impression of my current skill level. I would like them to have a modern and familiar experience, probably the most important thing to me would be for the site to be intuitive, familiar and simplistic.
